- 👋🏾 Hi, I’m Tayler
- 👀 I’m interested in diving into new technologies and experimenting with creative solutions.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning front-end development and user experience design. I'd like to contribute to meaningful projects and collaborate with others in tech.
- 💞️ Fun fact: I’m a dedicated lifelong learner with a love for fashion, sewing, and other creative expressions. Outside of coding, you might find me cooking new recipes, dancing, or immersing myself in books.
- 💬 I’d love to connect, learn, and collaborate! Feel free to explore my repositories or get in touch.
